        Bookshops are places of magical discoveries and the rediscovery of past
        pleasures. My bookshop, in fact any bookshop, makes me very happy.
        -Liane Moriarty

        You see, bookshops are dreams built of wood and paper. They are time
        travel and escape and knowledge and power. They are, simply put, the
        best of places. ~Jen Campbell,

        A bookstore is one of the only pieces of evidence we have that people
        are still thinking. ~Jerry Seinfeld

        I believe in the magic of books. I believe that during certain periods
        in our lives we are drawn to particular books–whether it’s strolling
        down the aisles of a bookshop with no idea whatsoever of what it is that
        we want to read and suddenly finding the most perfect, most wonderfully
        suitable book staring us right in the face. Unblinking. Or a chance
        meeting with a stranger or friend who recommends a book we would never
        ordinarily reach for. Books have the ability to find their own way into
        our lives. ~Cecelia Ahern
